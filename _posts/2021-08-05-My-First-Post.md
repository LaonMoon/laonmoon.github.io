## Hello, World!
This is my first post on this blog. I'll record what I study.

## Why I start blog?
Actually I have other blogs, but I wanted the one created on github. Because I'm learning Programming!

Probably the post will have something to do with programming.

## What I want to do?

### Programming
- Django
- Flask
- Bootstrap
- Flutter

### Artificial Intelligence
- Deep Learning
- Machine Learning
- NLP(Natural Language Processing)

### Other things
- Improve English skill
- Learn German
    - Use Drops, and DW learn
- Writing a novel
- Study stock
    - read a classic
- Reading a book
- Learn guitar

## Wrap up
I think it would be better to leave the old posts for a while. It's because I'm not familiar with markdown yet.

+) I love this theme!
